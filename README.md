# _GitHub Pages Deploy Branch_

Because of `GitHub` could only deploy `GitHub Pages` with `docs` directory of target
branch, remains the `docs` in `branch:gh-pages` for deploy contents that generated from
`branch:main`.

You could use `deploy.sh` in `branch:main` to auto generate and deploy.

**DO NOT EDIT THE CONTENTS ON CURRENT BRANCH!!!**
